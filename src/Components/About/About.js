            Skyware envisions a future with zero post harvest storage losses.
            Currently 1 Billion MT of food is wasted annually during the
            processing stage. Skyware holds the virtue to turn the tables around
            this problem with its high-tech IoT and AI-based scientific storage
            solutions. Built with the help of modern technology our products can
            mitigate the inefficiencies during warehouse management and turn the
            storage unit into a modern high-tech facility with added benefits to
            the customer. The likes of our storage solutions donâ€™t exist in the
            Indian Markets.
